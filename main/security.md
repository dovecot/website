# Security

Dovecot was designed since the beginning with security in mind and with many ways to provide privilege separation. Although the code is written with C, itâ€™s a little bit special C variant that makes it much more difficult to write security holes accidentally than with most other C-based projects.
 
Please see [bugreport-mail](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/issues.html) for more information how to report bugs.

Below is the list of all security holes found from Dovecot. Note that most of these are quite minor holes
